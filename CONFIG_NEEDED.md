# Configuration Needed

I found that your code files still have placeholder values. Please provide the following information so I can update all files correctly:

## 1. Google Spreadsheet ID

**Location:** Code.gs line 19

**Current value:** `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE`

**Where to find it:**
- Open your Google Sheet
- Look at the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[THIS_IS_YOUR_SHEET_ID]/edit`
- Copy the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`

**Your Spreadsheet ID:** _______________________________


## 2. Google Apps Script Web App URL

**Locations:** booking-flow.js, main.js

**Current value:** Still fetching from local JSON file

**Where to find it:**
- Open your Apps Script project
- Click "Deploy" → "Test deployments" or "Manage deployments"
- Copy the Web App URL (looks like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby...ABC123/exec`)

**Your Web App URL:** _______________________________


## Questions:

1. **Have you deployed the Google Apps Script as a Web App?** (Yes/No)

2. **Have you created the Google Sheet with all 8 tabs?** (Yes/No)

3. **What errors are you seeing in the browser console?** (Copy/paste them here)


Please provide these values and I'll update all the files for you.
